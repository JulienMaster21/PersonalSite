    'text1' => 'On this page I will express my opinion and data on the field of IT.',
    'text2' => 'Firstly, I will begin with what I have learned at the HBO-I Job Event.
                There were surprisingly many different kinds of organisations present.
                The first example is the Rabobank. The representative has told me about the different
                positions that were available such as business analyst, operations engineer and etc.
                Further, he has told me about ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library).
                They use this to divide the managerial processes in logical groups.',
    'text3' => 'Besides the Rabobank there were multiple government agencies present such as: the CBS and the
                Ministry of Defense. I personally found the CBS to be more interesting than Defense.
                In my conversation with the CBS representative I learned that Data Scientist is the
                most wanted position.',
    'text4' => 'As my next example I have a, according to my opinion, hilariously named company called dongIT.
                The reason why I find the name so funny is that this is a company
                that performs pentests (penetration tests) to test the security of websites and the like.
                Besides pentests they also write software with PHP.',
    'text5' => 'After this I have spoken with the company chipSoft.
                ChipSoft is a company that specialises itself in medical software.
                They were searching for new software developers. Further, they use the method of Scrum.
                That is a method that is used where the developers themselves will decide what they will do and when.
                The amount and quality of the work that is delivered is still monitored.',
    'text6' => 'As last I have spoken with the company ETTU. They were searching for AI engineers.
                Besides this the representative said that they were working with Blockchain technology.',
    'text7' => 'Here I will give an assessment of the companies that we have visited while on the companies safari.',
    'text8' => 'Colijn IT is a company that develops software for the furniture industry.
                This company has existed for a long time and that puts me at ease.',
    'text9' => 'Syntess is a company that develops software for all kinds of companies.
                They make use of: Scrum and Agile Development. I like the look of this company,
                but I find it is too formal.',
    'text10' => 'YourSuprise is a gift website. They make use of: Big data, Databases, PHP, JS, Docker,
                A/B Testing and Business Intelligence. The company is very informal and I like that,
                but it is too informal for me.',
    'text11' => 'Car Collect is a company that develops a platform for companies to bid on cars.
                I like this company mostly because it might be on of the first to block Internet Explorer,
                but I think that the company is slightly too new.',
    'text12' => 'Omoda is a fashion company. I think this company isn\'t very interesting,
                because I don\'t really care about the product and you can\'t really innovate in the technology.',
