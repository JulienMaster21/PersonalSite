    'main1' => '"Motivation is the feeling that drives you to the starting and finishing of a task."
                According to "Wat is motivatie? - cursus Medewerkers motiveren" (n.d.). According to Dotsolutions
                (n.d.) motivation is the reason why we are brought to action.
                Thus motivation is the incentive that keeps us busy.',
    'main2' => 'According to "Ken jij de 4 typen motivatie? | Control & Motivate" (2016)
                there are 4 kinds of motivation: Intrinsic motivation, Identification, Introjection
                and Extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation, is the kind of motivation that you have when
                an activity itself motivates you. Identification, is the kind of motivation that you have when you
                do something to belong to a group. If you do something because you might lose status,
                that is called Introjection. Extrinsic motivation, is the kind of motivation where
                you\'re only doing something because you want to avoid punishment or to gain a reward.',
    'main3' => 'Dan Pink also has something to say about motivation. In his TED talk Pink (n.d.) he describes
                "The Candle problem". This is a psychological test where one has to attach a candle to a wall
                without the wax dripping down. This test is used to determine which kind of motivation works best.
                The scientists have tested this by assembling 2 groups:
                One group is asked to complete the test in about average time and the other group is told
                that they will receive a financial reward for completing the task as soon as possible.
                The result, the group that wasn\'t paid finished on average a few minutes earlier than the paid group.
                The given explanation for this is that people who are paid work harder,
                but are less creative than volunteers.',
    'main4' => 'From the article of Van Der Veen (n.d.) it becomes apparent that software testers agree
                with Dan Pink\'s ideas. Like him, they want that employees gain autonomy over their work.
                They also want to convince their employers that the testing of software is important and they do
                this with intrinsic motivation. The article also mentions that most of the software testers had chosen
                their profession, because they like it and find it flexible, and that the salary was less important.',
    'main5' => 'According to the article from "Prestatiemotivatie ontwikkelen" (n.d.) intrinsic motivation is
                important for the business sector. Additionally, it also says that performance motivation is
                mostly recognised by: little performance anxiety and the preference for challenging assignments
                that match their skills. Everything the article says about performance motivation corresponds to
                what Dan Pink has said.',

    ],
    'main7' => 'I mostly agree with the results of the test, but I would like to highlight a couple of things.
                The course that I am currently enrolled in fits with my interests, because in highschool I chose of IT
                and I liked it and found it motivating. Additionally, I agree that I am intrinsically motivated,
                because I programmed outside of the scope of IT in highschool.',
    'main8' => 'For someone that has creativity as a career anchor, the creation of new ideas and products
                is the primary goal. The incentive is being innovative. A work environment that is procedural
                and leaves little room for own initiative can be experienced as very limiting.
                Creative people tend to work individually or in small teams.',
    'main9' => 'I have always been creative and I specifically found the creation of things interesting.
                Currently, I mostly occupy myself with my hobby of Warhammer 40.000. I think this is a good example,
                because the hobby gives me intrinsic motivation to stay creative and to solve problems creatively.',
    'main10' => 'These people have the want to be good at something. They\'re in general quite inquisitive and
                like to be valued as an expert. They prefer to be addressed as the professional within an organisation.
                Specialists tend to work independently.
                The demarcation of a task or activity is an important incentive.',
    'main11' => 'I chose IT as an optional class in highschool and I also wrote a paper for it.
                I always found computers interesting, but I only had a proper introduction to programming
                during IT class. Here I got a taste for it and was immediately intrinsically motivated,
                because I was much faster and more enthusiastic in class than my classmates.',
    'main12' => 'People with this incentive attach much value to social contacts. Sociability and friendship
                are important reasons for having a profession. The division between work and private life is less
                important for them. Career choices are often influenced whether they will meet enough colleagues.
                If they like the work depends on the degree of team work and social contact.',
    'main13' => 'I have never been very social and I haven\'t ever felt the need for friends or social contacts.
                I guess it doesn\'t help that I am autistic. Normally, I will only form social contacts
                with extrinsic motivation, but I understand that it is an important factor for this course
                and will try to improve.',
    'main14' => 'I think I already had a pretty good idea how I was motivated. I think I am well
                and intrinsically motivated. My points of improvement are to learn to plan better
                and to improve my social skills.',
    'main15' => 'According to my father, my conclusion is mostly correct, but I might underestimate the difficulty
                of the course. He also agrees on what my points of improvement are.',
